I write here about my interactions with technology (eg. CS, Data, AI, etc) such as 
challenges, lessons learned, and my understanding of those concepts. Having said that, 
I am a bit obsessed with the social and political side of the phenomena as well. So, 
I will probably get off the track sometimes to discuss how tech may have a way with 
the community if I come across an insight that interests me.

Share of thoughts are absolutely welcomed!
